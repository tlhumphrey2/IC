Even though you have  credentials from Amazon, it still takes a while for Amazon to fully enable your account.  You''re almost there. Try again in an hour or two.</p>

<p>The second most common reason is that you requested a cluster size that would cause you to exceed the default limits imposed by Amazon.  At the time of this writing, Amazon sets that default limit to no more than 20 total EC2 instances per account.  Don''t worry -- many people launch significantly larger clusters on Amazon.  Use the link <a href=`http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/ec2-request/` target=`_blank`>`AWS Limit Increase Request`</a> to request a limit increase.  You will need to know that this site currently launches `Large` `Linux` instances in the `US East` region by default.  You will also need your account number found in the upper right hand corner of  the <a href=`https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key` target=`_blank`>AWS Access Keys</a> page.</p>

<p>It is possible that Amazon is running slow.  Check the link <a href=`http://status.aws.amazon.com/` target=`_blank`>`AWS Health Dashboard`</a> to see if Amazon AWS is experiencing issues.</p>

You will also see a new security group configured specifically for your new cluster and a new key pair.  Both will have the same name as your cluster.</p>
